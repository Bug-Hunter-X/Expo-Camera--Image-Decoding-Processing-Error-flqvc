This error occurs when using the Expo SDK's `Camera` component with certain image formats.  The error message might vary slightly, but it usually indicates a problem decoding or processing the image data.  This is often caused by an incompatibility between the image format and the Expo Camera's internal image processing pipeline. For example, using an image with an unsupported codec or corrupted metadata could lead to this issue. The image may appear fine in other applications but fails to display in Expo.
